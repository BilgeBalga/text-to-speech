# üìù Text To Speech Application üé§

This project is a Text To Speech (TTS) application built using Streamlit. It allows users to upload a text file, select the source and target languages, and convert the text to speech. The generated speech can be downloaded as an MP3 file.

## Features

- Upload a `.txt` file for text input.
- Select the input language and the language for vocalization.
- Translate the text (if necessary) and convert it to speech.
- Download the generated speech as an MP3 file.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: For converting text to speech.
- **translate**: For translating text between different languages.
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the application.
